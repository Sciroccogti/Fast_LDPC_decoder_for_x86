# Fast_LDPC_decoder_for_x86
The source codes of the fast x86 LDPC decoder published

In this git repository we published the source code of a LDPC decoder
implementation optimized for x86 target. This LDPC decoder implementation
efficiently takes advantage of the SIMD and SPMT programming model. The
appraoch used to achieve very high 

Originally, this source code piece is part of a much larger project
that enables us to experiment LDPC decoding algorithm, data format, etc.
It explains why some piece of code are useless for you ;-)
